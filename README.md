Project Description

This project is a web app we built to let users search for football players, view their stats, and compare them. We also added a feature that allows users to save their favorite players. The main goal of the project was to provide an easy way for users to explore football player data, compare stats, and manage their favorites.
As a team, we developed the basic structure of the website, allowing users to search for players and see detailed information about their stats like goals, assists, and more. We also made it possible to compare two players at once, showing who is better in specific areas. We also created a feature where users can save players as favorites and remove them when needed.
We used CSS to build the layout and style the app. JavaScript was used to make the app interactive, like displaying player data when a search is done or updating player stats. We integrated an external API named apifotball to get real-time data. We also made sure the app is user-friendly, with buttons for easy navigation and features like searching and comparing players.
Overall, our project is focused on helping football fans find player stats easily and compare them in a simple and enjoyable way.
